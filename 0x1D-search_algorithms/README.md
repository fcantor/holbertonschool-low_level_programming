# 0x1D. C - Search Algorithms

The purpose of this project is to learn and master the following concepts:
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements for Tasks
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- Your code should use the ```Betty``` style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the ```printf``` function of the standard library. Any call to another function like ```strdup```, ```malloc```, … is forbidden.
- In the following examples, the ```main.c``` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own ```main.c``` files at compilation. Our ```main.c``` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called ```search_algos.h```
