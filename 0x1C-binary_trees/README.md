# 0x1C. C - Binary trees

![Binary Search Tree](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/0a4d0c53171193.592b186f94827.png)

The purpose of this project is to introduce and master the following concepts:
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
