# 0x0E. C - Function pointers
This project contains programs that introduce function pointers: what they are, how to use them, what they hold, and where it points to in virtual memory.

## 0. What's my name

This program contains a function that prints a name.

## 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
File: 1-array_iterator.c

This program contains a funtion that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

## 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
File: 2-int_index.c

This program contains a function that searches for an integer.

## 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Files: 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h

These programs contain a function that search for an integer.
